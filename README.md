Datasets Join Challenge
This project focuses on integrating and harmonizing data from three distinct datasets, each describing information about the same companies from different sources. The objective is to create a unified dataset that consolidates all available information with improved accuracy for each column. Below are the details of the input datasets:

Input Datasets
Google Dataset

Columns: address, category, city, country code, country name, name, phone, phone country code, raw address, raw phone, region code, region name, text, zip code, domain.
Facebook Dataset

Columns: domain, address, categories, city, country code, country name, description, email, link, name, page type, phone, phone country code, region code, region name, zip code.
Website Dataset

Columns: root domain, domain suffix, language, legal name, main city, main country, main region, phone, site name, TLD, category (data columns are delimited by ;).
Objective
The goal is to create a fourth dataset that merges the information from all three sources while ensuring greater accuracy in key columns such as category, address, phone, and company name. This process involves data cleaning, deduplication, and validation techniques to reconcile inconsistencies across the datasets.
